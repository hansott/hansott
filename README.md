### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

**Software engineer with a strong interest in domain-driven design (DDD) and functional programming (FP)**

I'm deeply in love with clean code and I'll do anything to motivate other developers to leave the campground cleaner than they found it.

I'm addicted to learning new things and sharing knowledge.

Ask me about PHP, JavaScript, TypeScript, Node.js, Docker/Kubernetes, React, Elasticsearch, MySQL, GraphQL, open-source packages, parsers or CI/CD... I'm sure we'll have a great conversation. ;)

I'm the co-founder of [journy.io](https://github.com/journy-io).

When I'm not coding, I'll be playing on my [piano](https://github.com/hansott/piano) or [guitar](https://github.com/hansott/guitar)!
