### Hi there 👋

**Software engineer with a strong interest in domain-driven design (DDD) and functional programming (FP)**

I'm deeply in love with clean code and I'll do anything to motivate other developers to leave the campground cleaner than they found it. 🏕

I'm addicted to learning new things and sharing knowledge. 📚

I worked extensively with PHP in the past but these days I'm spending more time in JavaScript world, using TypeScript, Node.js and React as my main tools. 💚

Ask me about PHP, JavaScript, TypeScript, Node.js, Docker/Kubernetes, React, Elasticsearch, MySQL, GraphQL, open-source packages, parsers or CI/CD... I'm sure we'll have a great conversation.

I'm the co-founder of [journy.io](https://github.com/journy-io).

When I'm not coding, I'll be playing on my [piano](https://github.com/hansott/piano) or [guitar](https://github.com/hansott/guitar). 🎶
