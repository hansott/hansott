### Hi there 👋

**I'm a software engineer with a strong interest in domain-driven design (DDD) and functional programming (FP).**

I'm deeply in love with clean code and I'll do anything to motivate other developers to leave the campground cleaner than they found it. 🏕

I'm addicted to learning new things and sharing knowledge. 📚
